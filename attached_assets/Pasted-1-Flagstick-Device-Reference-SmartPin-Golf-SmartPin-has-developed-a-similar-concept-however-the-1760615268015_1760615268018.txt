1. Flagstick Device Reference – SmartPin Golf
SmartPin has developed a similar concept; however, their design integrates the entire flagstick. Please review their website and download their mobile app for additional context:
SmartPin Golf – SmartPin Golf
Our goal is to create a modular device that can quickly and easily attach to existing flagsticks, rather than replacing them entirely.
I encourage you to review their website & videos, as well as download/review their mobile application. 
2. Tee Box Camera Reference – Swingshot Cyclone
Here’s an example of the type of tee box camera we’re envisioning:
Swingshot Cyclone – Swingshot Cyclone Camera
This is just a basic example to use as reference, not the final design we're looking to achieve. 
3. Visual References
I’ve attached a few mock-up renders to illustrate what we envision for both the flagstick device and tee box camera. These are meant purely for visual reference at this stage.
4. Post-Shot Video Output Example
Also attached is an example of the final video concept, which includes:
Picture-in-picture (PIP) from the flagstick device
Ball flight and shot tracing
Text and logo overlays
Overall presentation style
Once you’ve had a chance to review everything—especially the scope and user journey outlined below—please confirm that all details are clear.
I want to make sure we’re 100% aligned on all project requirements before moving forward. 
If anything is unclear or needs clarification, don’t hesitate to reach out.
Thank you all for your time and attention to detail—excited to get started.

.ACE HUNTER — Updated MVP Scope & User Journey (With Tee-Box Camera Integration)
User Journey
Golfer Launches PWA
Golfer arrives at an ACE HUNTER-enabled Par 3 hole and opens the ACE HUNTER Progressive Web App (PWA) on their phone.
They confirm:
Course
Hole number
Tee box position (e.g., White, Blue, Red)
They select:
Skill Tier: Sniper (3 ft), Sharpshooter (6 ft), Marksman (9 ft), or Novice (12 ft)
Wager Amount: $5, $10, $25, $50, or $100
They complete payment through a secure payment gateway (One-click payment, i.e. Apple Pay / Stripe / PayPal / Crypto optional in later phases).
Device & Video Activation
Upon successful payment:
The PWA activates the correct tee-box camera and the flagstick device simultaneously.
The system identifies which tee-box camera to activate based on the golfer’s selected tee-box location in the PWA.
Each Par 3 hole may have multiple tee boxes, each with its own assigned camera, so activation must be dynamic and location-specific.
Tee-Box Camera Requirements 
Solar-powered + rechargeable battery (low-power standby mode).
Weatherproof, rugged IP-rated enclosure.
Auto-wake via PWA trigger (BLE, Wi-Fi Direct, or LoRa handshake).
High-definition wide-angle lens optimized for tee-to-green coverage (~150-200 yds).
Stable ground or pole mount positioned behind tee box at optimal angle for swing + ball launch capture.
Internal storage buffer for 10–20 sec pre-roll and post-shot video.
Secure wireless upload to backend or direct transfer to flagstick/edge node for AI analysis.
Shot Execution & Verification
Golfer hits their shot.
The tee-box camera records the full swing and initial ball flight.
The flagstick device:
Confirms hole-in-one with > 99 % accuracy.
Detects landing proximity of the ball up to a 12 ft radius with > 99 % accuracy.
Calculates exact distance from cup (cm-level precision).
Differentiates active shots from static balls already on the green.
Skill Tier Distances
Sniper = ≤ 3 ft
Sharpshooter = ≤ 6 ft
Marksman = ≤ 9 ft
Novice = ≤ 12 ft
Results Processing & Video Generation
Backend validates the shot outcome.
Payouts are instantly triggered if the result qualifies (hole-in-one or within tier).
A curated highlight video is auto-generated, merging feeds from:
Tee-box camera (golfer swing)
Flagstick camera(s) (impact and landing view) (PIP in lower right corner) 
AI-generated ball tracer overlay
ACE HUNTER branding + overlays (golfer name, rank, course, hole, wager tier).
